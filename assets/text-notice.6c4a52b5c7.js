// The privacy notice, version T-2026-10-10: 03-test-protocol-and-privacy.md section 4, word for word.
// Counsel edits before use. Business details come from config/site.json through the build.
// The host email-code paragraph is a build setting (HOST_ACCESS_NOTICE), so a family never sees a bracketed choice.
// The iPad and Android apps (site.app, set by tools/build-native.mjs) have no browser and no website host, so their
// notice says "this app" and says what TestFlight shares instead. Drafted October 21, 2026; counsel edits it too.
